  Surface new investment ideas for a long-only investor by scanning SEC filings and market
  data across the $50M–$10B US-listed universe. Use this skill to discover tickers you do not
  yet have, via four scans: insider buying (cluster/dip/rip buys from Form 4), market screens
  (near-52-week-low, high-short-interest, forgotten, and other presets), keyword/theme
  exposure across filing full-text, and conference presenters. Triggers include "find me new
  ideas", "show me insider buying", "run the screens", "who's exposed to [theme]", and "who's
  presenting this week". This skill *produces* tickers for the rest of the stack to research:
  reach for bottom-up-analyst to deep-dive a name you already have, market-scout for a quote,
  sec-edgar-skill for a specific filing.

# Signal Sweep

Top-of-funnel idea surfacing for long-only investors. Scans SEC filings and market data
across a configurable US-listed universe (NYSE, NASDAQ, OTC) and produces shortlists of
tickers with reasons. It sits upstream of the research stack — it *produces* tickers that
`bottom-up-analyst` then deep-dives. The market-cap floor and ceiling are set in
`screens.json` under `universe.market_cap_min` / `universe.market_cap_max` (default
$50M–$10B); all scripts read from that file.

## Capabilities

### 1. Insider buying scanner + 13D alerts

Scans Form 4 open-market purchases (code `P` only) and detects three signal types:

- **Cluster buys:** 2+ distinct insiders buying the same stock within the lookback
  window. Breadth signal — multiple people agree.
- **Dip buys:** an insider buys after an unusually large decline, measured against the
  stock's own volatility (trailing 30-day return z-score ≤ -1.5σ). A CEO buying into a
  -2σ drawdown on a normally calm stock is high-signal even without a second insider.
- **Rip buys:** an insider buys after an unusually large rally (z-score ≥ +1.5σ).
  Insiders usually buy on weakness — buying into strength suggests the move has legs.

The z-score is volatility-adjusted: a 20% drop is routine for a biotech but exceptional
for a utility. The threshold adapts to each stock's personality.

```bash
# On-demand
python scripts/scan_insiders.py --date yesterday --lookback 5

# Tighter threshold (only flag ≥2σ moves)
python scripts/scan_insiders.py --date yesterday --lookback 5 --zscore 2.0

# Daily CI with Discord webhook
python scripts/scan_insiders.py --date yesterday --lookback 5 --webhook $DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL
```

Option exercises, tax withholding, awards, gifts, and sales are filtered out.
`--help` for all flags.

### 2. Market screens

Config-driven screens via yfinance. Definitions live in `screens.json` — edit the JSON
to add or tweak screens, no Python changes needed.

```bash
python scripts/scan_market.py --screen near-52wk-low
python scripts/scan_market.py --all
python scripts/scan_market.py --list
```

The 7 presets: `near-52wk-low`, `high-short-interest`, `short-covering`, `insider-heavy`,
`fallen-from-grace`, `low-institutional`, `forgotten`. Each enriches the top results with
P/E, short %, insider %, analyst rating, and sector. `--no-enrich` for
faster runs. See `references/guide_screens.md` for the field reference and how to add
custom screens.

### 3. Keyword / theme discovery

Goes from a keyword to a list of exposed companies by searching the full text of SEC
filings via EDGAR's EFTS engine. Finds non-obvious exposures — the REIT that leases to
cannabis growers, the testing lab, the BDC that lends to the sector.

```bash
python scripts/search_themes.py --keyword "cannabis" --since 2026-01-01
python scripts/search_themes.py --keyword "tariff" --since 2025-01-01 --until 2026-06-17
```

Results are deduplicated by company, filtered to the configured universe, and enriched.

### 4. Conference discovery

Finds companies presenting at conferences by scanning 8-K Item 8.01 filings for
conference-related keywords.

```bash
python scripts/scan_conferences.py --start 2026-06-16 --end 2026-06-20
```

Item 8.01 is a catch-all, so expect some false positives. The interesting follow-ups are
interactive — "which of these also show insider buying?", "any in healthcare?"

## Output

Every script writes a timestamped `.md` to `signal-sweep-cache/` and prints the absolute
path to stdout (same `emit(path)` pattern as `sec-edgar-skill`). Market-cap lookups are
cached to disk with a 24h TTL.
